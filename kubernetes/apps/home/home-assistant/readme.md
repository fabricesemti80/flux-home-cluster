# Homeassitant

Create db user

```sh
postgres@postgres-1:/$ psql
# psql (14.7 (Debian 14.7-1.pgdg110+1))
# Type "help" for help.
postgres=# CREATE USER homeassistant WITH PASSWORD '<password from 1password>';
CREATE ROLE

postgres=#
```

- Ensure the `super user password` == `POSTGRES_SUPER_PASS`
- Ensure the created user name == `POSTGRES_USER`
- Ensure the created user password == `POSTGRES_PASS`
(these values should come from the `hass` secret in 1Password!)

With above, the db should be created by the deployment's `init-db` container.

## üîß Configuration

***important***:

[Multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) & network attacment should be present *before* the pod creates (or pod must be recreated) for additional networking to work.
